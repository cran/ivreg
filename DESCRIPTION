Description: Instrumental variable estimation for linear models by two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression. The main ivreg() model-fitting function is designed to provide a workflow as similar as possible to standard lm() regression. A wide range of methods is provided for fitted ivreg model objects, including extensive functionality for computing and graphing regression diagnostics in addition to other standard model tools.
